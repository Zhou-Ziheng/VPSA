# VPSA

VPSA is a community-driven platform built using technologies like React.js, Apollo, Express, MongoDB, and GraphQL. The primary goal was to create a space where Valorant players could showcase and certify their gaming skills. By leveraging Riot Sign On (SSO) for secure user authentication and integration with in-game profiles, VPSA allowed players to receive personalized PDF certificates upon successful skill validation. This project not only enhanced the Valorant gaming experience but also fostered a sense of achievement and camaraderie within the gaming community.
